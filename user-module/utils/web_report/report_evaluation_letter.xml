                <h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid rgb(25,25,112);">12. Financial Analysis</h3>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">The proposed amount estimated to be invested in the establishment and operation of the company is Five million, one hundred and seventy-eight thousand, four hundred thirty-nine united state dollars ($5,178,439.00). A significant portion of this amount representing 96.51% are proceeds from a loan obtained from a financial institution based in Germany and the remaining One Hundred and Seventy-Eight Thousand, Four Hundred and Thirty-Nine Ghana Cedis (GH₵178,439.00) representing 3.49% account for local equity of the company. In accordance with the loan terms, an amount of Nine Thousand, Three Hundred and Sixty-Two US Dollars, Fifty Cents (US$9,362.50) was paid as a commitment fee to the bank. This fee was promptly transferred, and a corresponding letter of evidence was provided.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">The recipient of the loan, AICP Ltd, serves as the parent company of AICP FZE Feed Ltd. It is important to note that AICP Ltd extended its full financial support to AICP FZE Feed Ltd by guaranteeing, through a letter of intent, that it would cover the financial requirements for the company's operations. This commitment was subsequently substantiated through financial analysis, which identified evidence in the form of purchase agreements and payment invoices for machinery, totaling One Million and Seven Thousand, Five Hundred US Dollars (US $1,007,500.00). The parent company played a pivotal role in facilitating the funding and acquisition of machinery for AICP FZE Feed Ltd.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">It is instructive to note however that, this loan was a purpose-specific-loan whose terms required that the borrower (applicant’s parent) to invest the loan amount in the purchase and export of machinery and other equipment from the Country where the bank is hosted. These are common arrangements banks undertake to mitigate risk and facilitate economic development of their host countries.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">In conclusion, the financial structure and funding mechanisms of AICP FZE Feed Ltd are closely intertwined with its parent company, AICP Ltd. While the purpose-specific loan for machinery acquisition adheres to common banking practices, the provision of a zero-account statement and the purchase agreements executed in the name of the parent company necessitate further clarification and transparency in the financial operations and governance of AICP FZE Feed Ltd. </p>

                <h5><strong>Recommendation</strong></h5>
                <p style="text-align:justify">AICP Ltd. has showcased its robust financial standing and the unwavering capacity to support the operations of AICP FZE Ltd.
